    <h1>Chocolate Croissant Bread Pudding</h1>
    <img src="../photos/ChocolateCroissant.jpg" alt="ChocolateCroissant">
    <p>This chocolate croissant bread pudding is a winner if you love bread pudding and love chocolate croissants! It's like a combination of a soft-brownie-cakey-chocolate-chip-cookie with a bit of a creamy texture inside. It tastes good warm, as all melted chocolate desserts do, but even better cooled. My daughters couldn't wait to eat it, so good luck holding out for it to cool.</p>

        <li>butter-flavored cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 cups 2% milk</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 vanilla bean, halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>4 large day-old chocolate croissants, cut into 1/2-inch-thick pieces</li>
